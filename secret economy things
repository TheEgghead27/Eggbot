currency ideas:

store all in stonks.json
one dict for actual monies
one dict for the shoppe

possible merch:
1 admin command (but not e!shutdown or e!say)
"secret" (e!pp")
1 use of roleGiver
	and maybe an extra expensive one for e!addroles

A note on server goals:
only server egg can be chipped in
e!goal [number] name (admin only)
notify admin when goal can be reached
e!add/remove egg for bonuses

exchange message/server egg for global egg (used in main shop)
rate 5 message egg for 1 global egg
commands have more
remember to *randomize* for that gambling aspect
maybe lootboxes??
