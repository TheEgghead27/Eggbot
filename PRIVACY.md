# Eggbot Privacy Policy

## Why we collect data
Eggbot collects certain information visible to the bot for bot functionality and administration.

## Deletion Policy
For the official instance of Eggbot, a user or server administrator may request that their data be deleted. However, we do not prevent the bot from recollecting the data from a future source.

If you are considered an Involved User, you may request that your attribution is removed in the code or from the official configuration. 

We recommend that hosters abide by these policies for their own instances, but we cannot guarantee that these standards will be followed.

## What we always collect

### User IDs
We collect the identification numbers of users known to Eggbot to store user profiles for the Economy System.

### Server IDs
We collect server identification codes to manage server-specific Eggs and Goals, also for the Economy System.

### User-Submitted Content
We save the message IDs, emoji names, and role IDs provided in the setup of an automatic Role Giver.
The names and prices of Goals set for a server are also saved.

### Involved Users' IDs
If you are involved in the development of Eggbot or are listed as an Administrator for the Eggbot instance, your identification number is saved for reference in bot functions (attribution and permission checks are the common uses).

## What we log in terminal (depending on configuration)

### Direct Messages to an active instance of the bot
The bot can log direct messages to itself in order to allow for manual managing and viewing of the private messages sent to the bot.

### All Messages
Mainly for debugging purposes, this setting will log the message author and content (text and attachments).

### Deleted Messages
The bot can log deleted message IDs, the ID of the channel the message originated from, and, if cached, the message content (text and attachments).
This is intended to be used in personal server administration, in order to preserve information that would be inaccessible otherwise.

### Emoji Names
If an Eggbot Administrator uses the "print_emoji" command, the raw emoji text will be printed to the terminal.

### Locked Command Usage
If a command locked to Eggbot Administrators is used, the terminal will log the username and identifier of the invoker.

##Note:
We reserve the right to revise this privacy policy without notice, as needed.
