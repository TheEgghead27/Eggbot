Narrator
According to all known laws of aviation, [n]there is no way a bee should be able to fly. [n][n]Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. [n]The bee, of course, flies anyway [n]because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Barry
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
Mother
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Barry
Coming! Hang on a second. 
Barry
(uses his antenna like a phone) Hello?
Adam
Barry?
Barry
Adam?
Adam
Can you believe this is happening?
Barry
I can't. I'll pick you up.
Barry
(flies down the stairs)
Father
Looking sharp.
Mother
Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
Barry
Sorry. I'm excited.
Father
Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's.
Mother
Very proud. (Rubs Barry's hair)
Barry
Ma! I got a thing going here.
Mother
You got lint on your fuzz.
Barry
Ow! That's me!
Mother
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye!
Mother
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Barry
Hey, Adam.
Adam
Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel?
Barry
A little. Special day, graduation.
Adam
Never thought I'd make it.
Barry
Three days grade school, three days high school...
Adam
Those were awkward.
Barry
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
Adam
You did come back different.
Artie
Hi, Barry!
Barry
Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Adam
Hear about Frankie?
Barry
Yeah.
Adam
You going to the funeral?
Barry
No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
Adam
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
The car
(does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)
Adam
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day.
Barry
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
Graduating Students
[playing "Pomp and Circumstances"]
Barry
Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
Barry
Well, Adam, today we are men.
Adam
We are!
Barry
Bee-men.
Adam
Amen!
Barry and Adam
Hallelujah!
Announcer
Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Dean Buzzwell
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... 9:15.
Dean Buzzwell
That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Adam
Will we pick our job today?
Barry
I heard it's just orientation.
Tour Guide
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry
This is it!
Barry and Adam
Wow.
Barry
Wow.
Tour Guide
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Tour Guide
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble scented and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
Everyone
Honey!
Tour Guide
[collects honey into a bottle and throws it into the crowd on the bus, where it is caught by a girl in the back.]
Adam
That girl was hot.
Barry
She's my cousin!
Adam
She is?
Barry
Yes, we're all cousins.
Adam
Right. You're right.
Tour Guide
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
Helmet Tester
[is being smashed into the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers, and boots. He lifts a thumbs up, but you can hear him groan]
Adam
What do you think he makes?
Barry
Not enough.
Tour Guide
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
Krelman Testers
[a wheel turns with bees on pegs, each of them wearing a finger-shaped hat.]
Barry
Wow, what does that do?
Tour Guide
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
Adam
[intrigued] Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Tour Guide
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
Everyone but Barry
[claps]
Barry
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
Adam
What's the difference?
Tour Guide
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
Barry
[upset] So you'll just work us to death?
Tour Guide
We'll sure try.
Everyone but Barry
[laughs]
[end scene]
[Barry and Adam are walking home together]
Adam
Wow! That blew my mind!
Barry
"Whats the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
Adam
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
Barry
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Adam
Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
Barry
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Adam
Like what? Give me one example.
[Barry and Adam stop walking]
[Hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect unison]
Barry
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Announcer
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Barry
Wait a second. Check it out.
Pollen Jocks
[fly in, circle around, land, and stand in line]
Barry
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Adam
Wow. I've never seen them this close.
Barry
They know what it's like outside the hive.
Adam
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Girl Bees
Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks!
Pollen Jock
[hook up their backpacks to pumps that transport nectar]
Lou Lo Duva
You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! [punching the pollen jocks in joy] I love it!
Adam
I wonder where they were.
Barry
I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Adam
Right.
Barry and Adam
(are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks)
Barry
Look at that. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
Adam
It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.
Barry
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. (waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)
Adam
Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
Barry
Distant. Distant.
Pollen Jock #1
Look at these two.
Pollen Jock #2
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Pollen Jock #1
Let's have fun with them.
Girl Bee #1
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Barry
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
Girl Bee #2
Oh, my!
Barry
I never thought I'd knock him out.
Girl Bee #1
(Looking at Adam) What were you doing during this?
Adam
Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
Barry
I can autograph that.
Pollen Jocks 
(walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and Adam really are pollen jocks.)
Pollen Jock #1
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Barry
Yeah. Gusty.
Pollen Jock #1
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Barry
Six miles, huh?
Adam
Barry!
Pollen Jock #2
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Barry
Maybe I am.
Adam
You are not!
Pollen Jock #1
We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?
Barry
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
The Scene
(cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at night)
Father
Hey, Honex!
Barry
Dad, you surprised me.
Father
You decide what you're interested in?
Barry
Well, there's a lot of choices. But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Father
Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.
Barry
You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
Father
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Father
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Mother
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
Barry
I'm not trying to be funny.
Father
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
Mother
You're gonna be a stirrer?
Barry
No one's listening to me!
Father
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
Barry
I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Barry's parents
(don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)
Father
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Barry
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
Janet
I'm so proud.
The Scene
(cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)
Adam
We're starting work today!
Barry
Today's the day.
Adam
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Barry
Yeah, right.
Job Lister
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Bee in front of line
Is it still available?
Job Lister
Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side.
Adam
What'd you get?
Bee in front of line
Picking crud out. Stellar! (He walks away)
Adam
Wow!
Job Lister
Couple of newbies?
Adam
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Job Lister
Make your choice.
Adam and Barry
(look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very confusing)
Adam
You want to go first?
Barry
No, you go.
Adam
Oh, my. What's available?
Job Lister
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Adam
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Job Lister
Sure, you're on. (Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head) (Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)
Job Lister
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. (Takes Adam's hat off) Wax monkey's always open.
Adam
The Krelman opened up again. What happened?
Job Lister
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Job Lister
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Adam
Oh, this is so hard! Stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry
(remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off) 
Adam
(turns around and sees Barry flying away) Barry!
Pollen Jock
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
Adam
(Through phone) What happened to you? Where are you?
Barry
I'm going out.
Adam
Out? Out where?
Barry
Out there.
Adam
Oh, no!
Barry
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
Adam
You're gonna die! You're crazy! [n](Barry hangs up) [n]Hello?
Pollen Jock #2
Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Barry
Hey, guys.
Pollen Jock #1
Look at that.
Pollen Jock #2
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Lou Lo Duva
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
Pollen Jock #1
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. (Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)
Lou Lo Duva
(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Bee with clipboard
(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that. Thank you.
Lou Lo Duva
OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Lou Lo Duva
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
Barry
That's awful.
Lou Lo Duva
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
Lou Lo Duva
All right, launch positions!
Pollen Jocks
(The Pollen Jocks run into formation)
Pollen Jocks
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Lou Lu Duva
Black and yellow!
Pollen Jocks
Hello!
Pollen Jock #1
(To Barry) You ready for this, hot shot?
Barry
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Pollen Jocks
Wind, check. Antennae, check. Nectar pack, check.
Pollen Jocks
Wings, check. Stinger, check. 
Barry
Scared out of my shorts, check.
Lou Lo Duva
OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers!
Pollen Jocks
(fly out of the hive)
Barry
Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite!
Barry
(flies through the kite) Wow! Flowers! 
Pollen Jock
(puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to heat sink goggles.)
Pollen Jock
This is the Blue Leader. We have roses visual.
Pollen Jock
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses!
Pollen Jock #1
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.  Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.
Pollen Jock
(fires a high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that suck up the nectar from the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun)
Barry
That is one nector collector!
Pollen Jock #1
Ever see polination up close?
Barry
No, sir.
Barry and the Pollen Jock
(fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles pollen as he goes)
Pollen Jock #1
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.
Barry
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
Pollen Jock #1
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Barry
Cool.
Pollen Jock #1
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don't we need those?
Pollen Jock #2
Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Pollen Jock #1
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Pollen Jock #2
Affirmative.
Pollen Jocks
(land near the "flowers" which, to the audience are obviously just tennis balls)
Ken
(In the distance) That was on the line!
Pollen Jock #1
This is the coolest. What is it?
Pollen Jock #2
I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.
Pollen Jock #1
Yeah, fuzzy.
Pollen Jock #1
(Sticks his hand on the ball but it gets stuck)
Pollen Jock #3
Chemical-y.
Pollen Jock #1
(finally gets his hand free from the tennis ball)
Pollen Jock #1
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
Pollen Jocks 
(turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on top of one of the tennis balls)
Pollen Jock #2
My sweet lord of bees!
Pollen Jock #3
Candy-brain, get off there!
Pollen Jock #1
(Pointing upwards) Problem!
A Human Hand 
(reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck to)
Barry
Guys!
Pollen Jock #2
This could be bad.
Pollen Jock #3
Affirmative.
Vanessa Bloome 
(starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick to it)
Barry
Very close.
Barry
Gonna hurt.
Barry
Mama's little boy.
Barry 
(is being hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is still stuck to the ball)
Pollen Jock #1
You are way out of position, rookie!
Ken
Coming in at you like a MISSILE!
Barry 
(flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball)
Barry
(In slow motion) Help me!
Pollen Jock #2
I don't think these are flowers.
Pollen Jock #3
Should we tell him?
Pollen Jock #1
I think he knows.
Barry
What is this?!
Ken
Match point!
Ken
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to EAT IT!
A Pollen Jock 
(coughs which confuses Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city)
Barry
Yowser!
Barry
(bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there)
BARRY:
Ew, gross.
Dad driving car
(turns on the air conditioner which blows Barry into the car)
Girl in car
There's a bee in the car! Do something!
Dad driving car
I'm driving!
Baby girl
(Waving at Barry) Hi, bee.
Barry 
(smiles and waves at the baby girl)
Guy in back of car
He's back here! He's going to sting me!
Girl in car
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
Barry 
(freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car)
Grandma in car
He blinked!
Grandma in car
(whips out some bee-spray and sprays everywhere in the car, climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)
Girl in car
Spray him, Granny!
Dad driving the car
What are you doing?!
B
(escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above the ground, safe.)
Barry
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
Barry
(sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds moving into this direction) I gotta get home.
Barry
Can't fly in rain.
Barry
Can't fly in rain.
A rain drop
(hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)
Barry
Can't fly in rain.
A second drop
(hits Barry again and he spirals downwards) 
Barry
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
WW2 plane sound effects 
(are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a plant inside an apartment near the window)
Vanessa
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken
Hey, check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.
Ken
You see? (Folds brochure resume out) Folds out.
Ken 
(closes the window, trapping Barry inside)
Barry
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
Barry 
(tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)
Barry
What was that?
Barry 
(keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back because the window is closed)
Barry 
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
Barry 
(taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)
Barry 
That is diabolical.
Ken
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
Andy
What's number one? Star Wars?
Ken
Nah, I don't go for that...
Ken
(makes finger guns and makes "pew pew pew" sounds and then stops)
Ken
...kind of stuff.
Barry
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
Ken
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
Barry
(Looking at the light on the ceiling) There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
Barry
(Starts flying towards the lightbulb) I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
Barry 
(hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the humans are sitting at)
Ken
I predicted global warming.
Ken
I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Andy 
(dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and is about to put it in his mouth)
Ken
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Andy 
(drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans freak out)
Ken
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Ken 
(has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but Vanessa saves him last second)
Vanessa
Wait! Don't kill him! (puts Barry in a glass to protect him)
Ken
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Vanessa
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Ken
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
Vanessa
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
Vanessa 
(picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)
Ken
My brochure!
Vanessa
There you go, little guy.
Vanessa 
(opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is still shocked that a human saved his life)
Ken
I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.
Vanessa
Put that on your resume brochure.
Ken
My whole face could puff up.
Andy
Make it one of your special skills.
Ken
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Ken 
(walks to the door) Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Ken
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Vanessa
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
Vanessa 
(tries to close door)
Ken
You could put carob chips on there.
Vanessa
Bye. (Closes door but Ken opens it again)
Ken
Supposed to be less calories.
VANESSA:
- Bye. (Closes door)
Fast forward to the next day,
Barry is still inside the house. He flies into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes
Barry
(Talking to himself) I gotta say something. She saved my life.
Barry
I gotta say something.
Barry
All right, here it goes.
Barry
(Turns back) Nah.
Barry
What would I say? I could really get in trouble.
Barry
It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
Barry
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Barry
I've got to.
Barry
(disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by again)
Barry
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
Barry
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
Barry
How should I start it?
Barry 
(strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows) "You like jazz?"
Barry 
No, that's no good.
Vanessa 
(is about to walk past Barry)
Barry 
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Barry 
...Hi!
Vanessa 
(gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the counter)
Barry 
I'm sorry.
Vanessa
You're talking.
Barry 
Yes, I know.
Vanessa
(Pointing at Barry) You're talking!
Barry 
I'm so sorry.
Vanessa
No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Barry 
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
Vanessa
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
Barry
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, (Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night) but they were all trying to kill me.
Barry
And if it wasn't for you...
Barry
I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
Vanessa
(stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)
Barry
That was a little weird.
Vanessa
I'm talking with a bee.
Barry
Yeah.
Vanessa
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
Barry
I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. 
Barry 
(turns to leave)
Vanessa 
Wait! How did you learn to do that?
Barry
(Flying back) What?
Vanessa
The talking...thing.
Barry
Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
Vanessa 
That's very funny.
Barry 
Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Barry   
Anyway...
Vanessa 
Can I...
Vanessa
...get you something?
Barry
Like what?
Vanessa
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
Barry
I don't want to put you out.
Vanessa 
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. It's just coffee.
Barry
I hate to impose.
Vanessa 
(starts making coffee)
Vanessa 
Don't be ridiculous!
Barry
Actually, I would love a cup.
Vanessa
Hey, you want rum cake?
Barry
I shouldn't.
Vanessa
Have some.
Barry 
No, I can't.
Vanessa 
Come on!
Barry
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Vanessa 
Where?
Barry 
These stripes don't help.
Vanessa 
You look great!
Barry
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Barry 
Are you all right?
Vanessa
(Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely) No. 
Flash forward in time.
(Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table on top of the apartment building drinking coffee)
Barry
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. 
Barry
He finally gets there.
Barry
He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.
Barry
And he says, "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?" (Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)
Vanessa
Is that a bee joke?
Barry
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Vanessa
Yeah, different.
Vanessa
So, what are you gonna do, Barry? 
Barry 
(stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it around with a straw like it's a gondola)
