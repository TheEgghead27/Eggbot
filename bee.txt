Narrator
According to all known laws of aviation, [n]there is no way a bee should be able to fly. [n][n]Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. [n]The bee, of course, flies anyway [n]because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Barry
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
Mother
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Barry
Coming! Hang on a second. 
Barry
(uses his antenna like a phone) Hello?
Adam
Barry?
Barry
Adam?
Adam
Can you believe this is happening?
Barry
I can't. I'll pick you up.
Barry
(flies down the stairs)
Father
Looking sharp.
Mother
Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
Barry
Sorry. I'm excited.
Father
Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's.
Mother
Very proud. (Rubs Barry's hair)
Barry
Ma! I got a thing going here.
Mother
You got lint on your fuzz.
Barry
Ow! That's me!
Mother
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye!
Mother
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Barry
Hey, Adam.
Adam
Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel?
Barry
A little. Special day, graduation.
Adam
Never thought I'd make it.
Barry
Three days grade school, three days high school...
Adam
Those were awkward.
Barry
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
Adam
You did come back different.
Artie
Hi, Barry!
Barry
Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Adam
Hear about Frankie?
Barry
Yeah.
Adam
You going to the funeral?
Barry
No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
Adam
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
The car
(does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)
Adam
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day.
Barry
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
Graduating Students
[playing "Pomp and Circumstances"]
Barry
Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
Barry
Well, Adam, today we are men.
Adam
We are!
Barry
Bee-men.
Adam
Amen!
Barry and Adam
Hallelujah!
Announcer
Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Dean Buzzwell
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... 9:15.
Dean Buzzwell
That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Adam
Will we pick our job today?
Barry
I heard it's just orientation.
Tour Guide
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry
This is it!
Barry and Adam
Wow.
Barry
Wow.
Tour Guide
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Tour Guide
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble scented and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
Everyone
Honey!
Tour Guide
[collects honey into a bottle and throws it into the crowd on the bus, where it is caught by a girl in the back.]
Adam
That girl was hot.
Barry
She's my cousin!
Adam
She is?
Barry
Yes, we're all cousins.
Adam
Right. You're right.
Tour Guide
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
Helmet Tester
[is being smashed into the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers, and boots. He lifts a thumbs up, but you can hear him groan]
Adam
What do you think he makes?
Barry
Not enough.
Tour Guide
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
Krelman Testers
[a wheel turns with bees on pegs, each of them wearing a finger-shaped hat.]
Barry
Wow, what does that do?
Tour Guide
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
Adam
[intrigued] Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Tour Guide
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
Everyone but Barry
[claps]
Barry
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
Adam
What's the difference?
Tour Guide
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
Barry
[upset] So you'll just work us to death?
Tour Guide
We'll sure try.
Everyone but Barry
[laughs]
[end scene]
[Barry and Adam are walking home together]
Adam
Wow! That blew my mind!
Barry
"Whats the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
Adam
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
Barry
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Adam
Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
Barry
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Adam
Like what? Give me one example.
[Barry and Adam stop walking]
[Hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect unison]
Barry
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Announcer
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Barry
Wait a second. Check it out.
Pollen Jocks
[fly in, circle around, land, and stand in line]
Barry
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Adam
Wow. I've never seen them this close.
Barry
They know what it's like outside the hive.
Adam
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Girl Bees
Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks!
Pollen Jock
[hook up their backpacks to pumps that transport nectar]
Lou Lo Duva
You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! [punching the pollen jocks in joy] I love it!
Adam
I wonder where they were.
Barry
I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Adam
Right.
Barry and Adam
(are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks)
Barry
Look at that. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
Adam
It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.
Barry
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. (waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)
Adam
Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
Barry
Distant. Distant.
Pollen Jock #1
Look at these two.
Pollen Jock #2
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Pollen Jock #1
Let's have fun with them.
Girl Bee #1
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Barry
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
Girl Bee #2
Oh, my!
Barry
I never thought I'd knock him out.
Girl Bee #1
(Looking at Adam) What were you doing during this?
Adam
Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
Barry
I can autograph that.
Pollen Jocks 
(walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and Adam really are pollen jocks.)
Pollen Jock #1
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Barry
Yeah. Gusty.
Pollen Jock #1
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Barry
Six miles, huh?
Adam
Barry!
Pollen Jock #2
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Barry
Maybe I am.
Adam
You are not!
Pollen Jock #1
We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?
Barry
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
The Scene
(cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at night)
Father
Hey, Honex!
Barry
Dad, you surprised me.
Father
You decide what you're interested in?
Barry
Well, there's a lot of choices. But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Father
Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.
Barry
You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
Father
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Father
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Mother
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
Barry
I'm not trying to be funny.
Father
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
Mother
You're gonna be a stirrer?
Barry
No one's listening to me!
Father
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
Barry
I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Barry's parents
(don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)
Father
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Barry
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
Janet
I'm so proud.
The Scene
(cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)
Adam
We're starting work today!
Barry
Today's the day.
Adam
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Barry
Yeah, right.
Job Lister
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Bee in front of line
Is it still available?
Job Lister
Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side.
Adam
What'd you get?
Bee in front of line
Picking crud out. Stellar! (He walks away)
Adam
Wow!
Job Lister
Couple of newbies?
Adam
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Job Lister
Make your choice.
Adam and Barry
(look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very confusing)
Adam
You want to go first?
Barry
No, you go.
Adam
Oh, my. What's available?
Job Lister
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Adam
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Job Lister
Sure, you're on. (Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head) (Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)
Job Lister
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. (Takes Adam's hat off) Wax monkey's always open.
Adam
The Krelman opened up again. What happened?
Job Lister
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Job Lister
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Adam
Oh, this is so hard! Stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry
(remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off) 
Adam
(turns around and sees Barry flying away) Barry!
Pollen Jock
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
Adam
(Through phone) What happened to you? Where are you?
Barry
I'm going out.
Adam
Out? Out where?
Barry
Out there.
Adam
Oh, no!
Barry
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
Adam
You're gonna die! You're crazy! [n](Barry hangs up) [n]Hello?
Pollen Jock #2
Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Barry
Hey, guys.
Pollen Jock #1
Look at that.
Pollen Jock #2
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Lou Lo Duva
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
Pollen Jock #1
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. (Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)
Lou Lo Duva
(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Bee with clipboard
(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that. Thank you.
Lou Lo Duva
OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Lou Lo Duva
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
Barry
That's awful.
Lou Lo Duva
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
Lou Lo Duva
All right, launch positions!
Pollen Jocks
(The Pollen Jocks run into formation)
Pollen Jocks
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Lou Lu Duva
Black and yellow!
Pollen Jocks
Hello!
Pollen Jock #1
(To Barry) You ready for this, hot shot?
Barry
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Pollen Jocks
Wind, check. Antennae, check. Nectar pack, check.
Pollen Jocks
Wings, check. Stinger, check. 
Barry
Scared out of my shorts, check.
Lou Lo Duva
OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers!
Pollen Jocks
(fly out of the hive)
Barry
Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite!
Barry
(flies through the kite) Wow! Flowers! 
Pollen Jock
(puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to heat sink goggles.)
Pollen Jock
This is the Blue Leader. We have roses visual.
Pollen Jock
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses!
Pollen Jock #1
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.  Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.
Pollen Jock
(fires a high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that suck up the nectar from the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun)
Barry
That is one nector collector!
Pollen Jock #1
Ever see polination up close?
Barry
No, sir.
Barry and the Pollen Jock
(fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles pollen as he goes)
Pollen Jock #1
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.
Barry
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
Pollen Jock #1
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Barry
Cool.
Pollen Jock #1
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don't we need those?
Pollen Jock #2
Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Pollen Jock #1
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Pollen Jock #2
Affirmative.
Pollen Jocks
(land near the "flowers" which, to the audience are obviously just tennis balls)
Ken
(In the distance) That was on the line!
Pollen Jock #1
This is the coolest. What is it?
Pollen Jock #2
I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.
Pollen Jock #1
Yeah, fuzzy.
Pollen Jock #1
(Sticks his hand on the ball but it gets stuck)
Pollen Jock #3
Chemical-y.
Pollen Jock #1
(finally gets his hand free from the tennis ball)
Pollen Jock #1
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
Pollen Jocks 
(turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on top of one of the tennis balls)
Pollen Jock #2
My sweet lord of bees!
Pollen Jock #3
Candy-brain, get off there!
Pollen Jock #1
(Pointing upwards) Problem!
A Human Hand 
(reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck to)
Barry
Guys!
Pollen Jock #2
This could be bad.
Pollen Jock #3
Affirmative.
Vanessa Bloome 
(starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick to it)
Barry
Very close.
Barry
Gonna hurt.
Barry
Mama's little boy.
Barry 
(is being hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is still stuck to the ball)
Pollen Jock #1
You are way out of position, rookie!
Ken
Coming in at you like a MISSILE!
Barry 
(flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball)
Barry
(In slow motion) Help me!
Pollen Jock #2
I don't think these are flowers.
Pollen Jock #3
Should we tell him?
Pollen Jock #1
I think he knows.
Barry
What is this?!
Ken
Match point!
Ken
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to EAT IT!
A Pollen Jock 
(coughs which confuses Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city)
Barry
Yowser!
Barry
(bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there)
BARRY:
Ew, gross.
Dad driving car
(turns on the air conditioner which blows Barry into the car)
Girl in car
There's a bee in the car! Do something!
Dad driving car
I'm driving!
Baby girl
(Waving at Barry) Hi, bee.
Barry 
(smiles and waves at the baby girl)
Guy in back of car
He's back here! He's going to sting me!
Girl in car
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
Barry 
(freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car)
Grandma in car
He blinked!
Grandma in car
(whips out some bee-spray and sprays everywhere in the car, climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)
Girl in car
Spray him, Granny!
Dad driving the car
What are you doing?!
B
(escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above the ground, safe.)
Barry
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
Barry
(sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds moving into this direction) I gotta get home.
Barry
Can't fly in rain.
Barry
Can't fly in rain.
A rain drop
(hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)
Barry
Can't fly in rain.
A second drop
(hits Barry again and he spirals downwards) 
Barry
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
WW2 plane sound effects 
(are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a plant inside an apartment near the window)
Vanessa
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken
Hey, check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.
Ken
You see? (Folds brochure resume out) Folds out.
Ken 
(closes the window, trapping Barry inside)
Barry
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
Barry 
(tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)
Barry
What was that?
Barry 
(keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back because the window is closed)
Barry 
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
Barry 
(taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)
Barry 
That is diabolical.
Ken
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
Andy
What's number one? Star Wars?
Ken
Nah, I don't go for that...
Ken
(makes finger guns and makes "pew pew pew" sounds and then stops)
Ken
...kind of stuff.
Barry
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
Ken
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
Barry
(Looking at the light on the ceiling) There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
Barry
(Starts flying towards the lightbulb) I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
Barry 
(hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the humans are sitting at)
Ken
I predicted global warming.
Ken
I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Andy 
(dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and is about to put it in his mouth)
Ken
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Andy 
(drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans freak out)
Ken
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Ken 
(has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but Vanessa saves him last second)
Vanessa
Wait! Don't kill him! (puts Barry in a glass to protect him)
Ken
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Vanessa
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Ken
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
Vanessa
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
Vanessa 
(picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)
Ken
My brochure!
Vanessa
There you go, little guy.
Vanessa 
(opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is still shocked that a human saved his life)
Ken
I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.
Vanessa
Put that on your resume brochure.
Ken
My whole face could puff up.
Andy
Make it one of your special skills.
Ken
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Ken 
(walks to the door) Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Ken
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Vanessa
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
Vanessa 
(tries to close door)
Ken
You could put carob chips on there.
Vanessa
Bye. (Closes door but Ken opens it again)
Ken
Supposed to be less calories.
Vanessa
- Bye. (Closes door)
Fast forward to the next day,
Barry is still inside the house. He flies into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes
Barry
(Talking to himself) I gotta say something. She saved my life.
Barry
I gotta say something.
Barry
All right, here it goes.
Barry
(Turns back) Nah.
Barry
What would I say? I could really get in trouble.
Barry
It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
Barry
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Barry
I've got to.
Barry
(disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by again)
Barry
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
Barry
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
Barry
How should I start it?
Barry 
(strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows) "You like jazz?"
Barry 
No, that's no good.
Vanessa 
(is about to walk past Barry)
Barry 
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Barry 
...Hi!
Vanessa 
(gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the counter)
Barry 
I'm sorry.
Vanessa
You're talking.
Barry 
Yes, I know.
Vanessa
(Pointing at Barry) You're talking!
Barry 
I'm so sorry.
Vanessa
No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Barry 
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
Vanessa
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
Barry
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, (Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night) but they were all trying to kill me.
Barry
And if it wasn't for you...
Barry
I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
Vanessa
(stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)
Barry
That was a little weird.
Vanessa
I'm talking with a bee.
Barry
Yeah.
Vanessa
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
Barry
I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. 
Barry 
(turns to leave)
Vanessa 
Wait! How did you learn to do that?
Barry
(Flying back) What?
Vanessa
The talking...thing.
Barry
Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
Vanessa 
That's very funny.
Barry 
Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Barry   
Anyway...
Vanessa 
Can I...
Vanessa
...get you something?
Barry
Like what?
Vanessa
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
Barry
I don't want to put you out.
Vanessa 
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. It's just coffee.
Barry
I hate to impose.
Vanessa 
(starts making coffee)
Vanessa 
Don't be ridiculous!
Barry
Actually, I would love a cup.
Vanessa
Hey, you want rum cake?
Barry
I shouldn't.
Vanessa
Have some.
Barry 
No, I can't.
Vanessa 
Come on!
Barry
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Vanessa 
Where?
Barry 
These stripes don't help.
Vanessa 
You look great!
Barry
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Barry 
Are you all right?
Vanessa
(Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely) No. 
Flash forward in time.
(Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table on top of the apartment building drinking coffee)
Barry
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. 
Barry
He finally gets there.
Barry
He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.
Barry
And he says, "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?" (Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)
Vanessa
Is that a bee joke?
Barry
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Vanessa
Yeah, different.
Vanessa
So, what are you gonna do, Barry? 
Barry 
(stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it around with a straw like it's a gondola)
Barry 
About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
Vanessa 
I know how you feel.
Barry 
You do?
Vanessa 
Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Barry 
Really?
Vanessa 
My only interest is flowers.
Barry
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look...
Barry
(points to a tree in the middle of Central Park) There's my hive right there. See it?
Vanessa 
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Barry 
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
Vanessa 
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
Barry 
Why do girls put rings on their toes?
Vanessa 
Why not?
Barry 
It's like putting a hat on your knee.
Vanessa 
Maybe I'll try that.
A Custodian 
(installing a lightbulb looks over at them but to his perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup of coffee on the table)
A Custodian 
You all right, ma'am?
Vanessa 
Oh, yeah. Fine.
Vanessa
Just having two cups of coffee!
Barry 
Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.
Vanessa
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Barry 
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. 
Barry 
(points towards the rum cake) Can I take a piece of this with me?
Vanessa 
Sure! Here, have a crumb. (Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry)
Barry 
Thanks!
Vanessa 
Yeah.
Barry 
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
Vanessa 
OK, Barry...
Barry
And thank you so much again... for before.
Vanessa 
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Barry 
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... (Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because her hands is to big and Barry holds that) 
The Custodian
(looks over again and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her coffee again. The lightbulb that he was screwing in sparks and he falls off the ladder) 
Fast forward in time
(and we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute in a Honex wind tunnel) 
Bee Scientist #1 
This can't possibly work.
Bee Scientist #2 
He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. 
Dave 
(pulls the chute and the wind slams him against the wall and he falls on his face. The camera pans over and we see Barry and Adam walking together)
Adam 
Sounds amazing.
Barry 
It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
Adam
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans!
Adam
What were they like?
Barry 
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.
Adam 
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
Barry 
Some of them. But some of them don't.
Adam 
How'd you get back?
Barry 
Poodle.
Adam
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your "experience." Now you can pick out your job and be normal.
Barry 
Well...
Adam 
Well?
Barry 
Well, I met someone.
Adam 
You did? Was she Bee-ish? A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
Barry 
No, no, no, not a wasp.
Adam 
Spider?
Barry 
I'm not attracted to spiders. I know, for everyone else, it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.
Barry
I can't get by that face.
Adam 
So who is she?
Barry 
She's... human.
Adam 
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
Barry 
Her name's Vanessa. (Adam puts his head in his hands)
Adam 
Oh, boy.
Barry
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Adam 
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
Barry 
We're not dating.
Adam
You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M 80s! That's one eighth a stick of dynamite!
Barry 
She saved my life! And she understands me.
Adam 
This is over!
Barry
Eat this. (Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats it)
Adam 
(Adam's tone changes) This is not over! What was that?
Barry 
They call it a crumb.
Adam 
It was so stingin' stripey!
Barry 
And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!
Barry
You know what a Cinnabon is?
Adam 
No.
Adam 
(opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)
Barry 
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
Adam 
Be quiet!
Barry 
They heat it up...
Adam 
Sit down! (Adam forces Barry to sit down)
Barry 
(Still rambling about Cinnabons) ...really hot! (Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders)
Adam 
Listen to me!
Adam
We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!
Barry
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
Adam 
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
Adam
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
Barry 
Thinking bee.
Worker Bee 
Thinking bee.
Worker Bees and Adam 
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! [n] Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Flash forward in time:
(Barry is laying on a raft in a pool full of honey. He is wearing sunglasses)
Mother 
There he is. He's in the pool.
Father 
You know what your problem is, Barry? 
Barry 
(pulls down his sunglasses and he looks annoyed)
Barry 
(Sarcastic) I gotta start thinking bee?
Mother 
How much longer will this go on?
Father 
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
Barry
(puts sunglasses back on) I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
Father 
What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Mother
Would it kill you to make a little honey? 
Barry 
(rolls off the raft and sinks into the honey pool)
Mother
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
Mother
Martin, would you talk to him?
Father 
Barry, I'm talking to you! 
Barry 
(keeps sinking into the honey until he is suddenly in Central Park having a picnic with Vanessa) (Barry has a cup of honey and he clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly a mosquito lands on Vanessa and she slaps it, killing it. They both gasp but then burst out laughing)
Vanessa
You coming? (The camera pans over and Vanessa is climbing into a small yellow airplane)
Barry 
Got everything?
Vanessa
All set!
Barry 
Go ahead. I'll catch up. (Vanessa lifts off and flies ahead)
Vanessa
Don't be too long.
Barry 
(catches up with Vanessa and he sticks out his arms like an airplane. He rolls from side to side, and Vanessa copies him with the airplane)
Vanessa
Watch this! (Barry stays back and watches as Vanessa draws a heart in the air using pink smoke from the plane, but on the last loop the loop she suddenly crashes into a mountain and the plane explodes. The destroyed plane falls into some rocks and explodes a second time)
Barry
Vanessa! 
As Barry is yelling 
(his mouth fills with honey and he wakes up, discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back into the honey pool) 
Father 
We're still here.
Mother 
I told you not to yell at him. 
Mother
He doesn't respond to yelling!
Father 
Then why yell at me?
Mother 
Because you don't listen!
Father 
I'm not listening to this.
Barry 
Sorry, I've gotta go.
Father 
Where are you going?
Barry 
I'm meeting a friend.
Mother 
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Barry 
Bye. (Barry flies out the door and Martin shakes his head)
Mother
I just hope she's Bee-ish. 
Fast forward in time:
(and Barry is sitting on Vanessa's shoulder and she is closing up her shop) 
Barry
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? 
Vanessa 
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
Barry
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
Vanessa 
No. 
Vanessa
All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?
Barry
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
Vanessa 
Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.
Barry 
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
Vanessa 
You don't have that?
Barry 
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Vanessa 
Oh, my. (A human walks by and Barry narrowly avoids him)
Passerby
Dumb bees!
Vanessa 
You must want to sting all those jerks.
Barry 
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
Vanessa 
So you have to watch your temper (They walk into a store)
Barry 
Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion. Anger, jealousy, lust. 
Suddenly 
(an employee (Hector) hits Barry off of Vanessa's shoulder. Hector thinks he's saving Vanessa)
Vanessa 
(To Barry) Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? (Barry is getting up off the floor)
Barry 
Yeah.
Vanessa 
(To Hector) What is wrong with you?!
HECTOR 
(Confused) It's a bug.
Vanessa 
He's not bothering anybody. 
Vanessa
Get out of here, you creep! (Vanessa hits Hector across the face with the magazine he had and then hits him in the head. Hector backs away covering his head) 
Barry 
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? (Vanessa sets Barry back on her shoulder)
Vanessa 
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
Barry 
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy five is pretty much our limit.
Vanessa
You've really got that down to a science.
Barry 
Oh, we have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
Vanessa
I'll bet. 
Barry 
(looks to his right and notices there is honey for sale in the aisle)
Barry
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? (Barry looks at all the brands of honey, shocked) How did this get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? 
Barry 
(puts his hands up and slowly turns around, a look of disgust on his face)
Vanessa 
Is he that actor?
Barry 
I never heard of him.
Barry
Why is this here?
Vanessa 
For people. We eat it.
Barry
You don't have enough food of your own?! 
Hector 
(looks back and notices that Vanessa is talking to Barry)
Vanessa 
Well, yes.
Barry 
How do you get it?
Vanessa 
Bees make it.
Barry 
I know who makes it!
Barry
And it's hard to make it!
Barry 
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
Vanessa 
It's organic.
Barry 
It's our ganic!
Vanessa 
It's just honey, Barry.
Barry 
Just what?!
Barry
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?!
Barry
I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! 
Flash forward in time: 
(Barry paints his face with black stripes like a soldier and sneaks into the storage section of the store) 
Two men, including Hector
(are loading boxes into some trucks)
Supermarket Employee
Hey, Hector. You almost done?
Hector
Almost.
Barry 
(takes a step to peak around the corner)
Barry 
(Whispering) He is here. I sense it.
Hector
Well, I guess I'll go home now (Hector pretends to walk away by walking in place and speaking loudly) and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
Barry 
You're busted, box boy!
Hector
I knew I heard something! So you can talk!
Barry 
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
Barry
Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
Hector
I don't understand. I thought we were friends.
Hector
The last thing we want to do is upset bees! 
Hector 
(takes a thumbtack out of the board behind him and sword fights Barry. Barry is using his stinger like a sword)
Hector
You're too late! It's ours now!
Barry
You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
Hector
You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! 
Barry 
(hits the thumbtack out of Hectors hand and Hector surrenders)
Barry 
Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
Hector 
(Pointing to leaving truck) Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! 
Barry 
(chases after the truck but it is getting away. He flies onto a bicyclists' backpack and he catches up to the truck)
Car Driver
(To bicyclist) Crazy person!
Barry 
(flies off and lands on the windshield of the Honey farms truck.)
Barry 
(looks around and sees dead bugs splattered everywhere)
Barry 
What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! 
Barry 
(hears a sudden whisper) (Barry looks up and sees Mooseblood, a mosquito playing dead)
Mooseblood 
Just keep still.
Barry 
What? You're not dead?
Mooseblood
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
Barry 
To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
Mooseblood
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! 
Another bug playing dead 
I'm going to Tacoma. 
Barry 
(looks at another bug)
Barry 
And you?
Mooseblood 
He really is dead.
Barry
All right. 
Another bug 
(hits the windshield and the drivers notice. They activate the windshield wipers)
Mooseblood
Uh oh! (The windshield wipers are slowly sliding over the dead bugs and wiping them off)
Barry 
What is that?!
Mooseblood 
Oh, no! A wiper! Triple blade!
Barry 
Triple blade?
Mooseblood 
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! 
Mooseblood and Barry
(grab onto the wiper and they hold on as it wipes the windshield) 
Mooseblood
Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!
Mooseblood
How much do you people need to see?! (Bangs on windshield) Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!
Radio in truck
From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell.
Mooseblood 
But don't kill no more bugs! 
Mooseblood and Barry 
(are washed off by the wiper fluid)
Mooseblood 
Bee!
Barry 
Moose blood guy!!
Barry 
(starts screaming as he hangs onto the antenna) 
Suddenly 
(it is revealed that a water bug is also hanging on the antenna.) 
There is a pause
(and then Barry and the water bug both start screaming)
Truck Driver 
You hear something?
Guy in truck
Like what?
Truck Driver 
Like tiny screaming.
Guy in truck
Turn off the radio.
The antenna 
(starts to lower until it gets to low and sinks into the truck.)
The water bug 
(flies off)
Barry 
(is forced to let go and he is blown away. He luckily lands inside a horn on top of the truck where he finds Mooseblood, who was blown into the same place)
Mooseblood 
Whassup, bee boy?
Barry
Hey, Blood. 
Fast forward in time:
(and we see that Barry is deep in conversation with Mooseblood. They have been sitting in this truck for a while)
Barry
...Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
Mooseblood 
Wow!
Barry
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.
Mooseblood 
Bees hang tight.
Barry 
We're all jammed in. It's a close community.
Mooseblood 
Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
Barry 
What if you get in trouble?
Mooseblood 
You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack.
Mooseblood
See a mosquito, smack, smack!
Barry 
At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.
Mooseblood
Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.
Mooseblood 
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. 
An ambulance 
(passes by and it has a blood donation sign on it) You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! 
Mooseblood 
(leaves and flies onto the window of the ambulance where there are other mosquitos hanging out)
Mooseblood 
Hey, guys!
Other Mosquito 
Mooseblood!
Mooseblood 
I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? 
The truck 
(goes out of view and Barry notices that the truck he's on is pulling into a camp of some sort)
Truck Driver
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. (Barry flies out)
Barry 
What is this place?
Beekeeper #1 
A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
Beekeeper #2 
They are pinheads! Pinhead.
Beekeeper #2 
Check out the new smoker.
Beekeeper #1 
Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!
Barry 
Smoker?
Beekeeper #1 
Ninety puffs a minute, semi automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
Beekeeper #2
They make the honey, and we make the money.
Barry
"They make the honey, and we make the money"? 
The Beekeeper 
(sprays hundreds of cheap miniature apartments with the smoker. The bees are fainting or passing out) 
Barry
Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? 
Barry 
(flies into one of the apartment and helps a Bee couple get off the ground. They are coughing and its hard for them to stand) 
Bee in Apartment
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
Barry
Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? 
Bee in Apartment
Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. 
The apartment room 
(is completely empty except for a photo on the wall of the "queen" who is obviously a man in women's clothes)
Barry 
This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!
Barry
That's a drag queen!
Barry 
What is this? 
Barry 
(flies out and he discovers that there are hundreds of these structures, each housing thousands of Bees) 
Barry
Oh, no! There's hundreds of them!
Barry 
(takes out his camera and takes pictures of these Bee work camps. The beekeepers look very evil in these depictions) 
Barry
Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
Barry
This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. 
Flash forward in time:
(and Barry is showing these pictures to his parents)
Mother 
Oh, Barry, stop.
Father
Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
Barry 
Do these look like rumors? (Holds up the pictures)
Uncle Carl
That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.
Mother 
How did you get mixed up in this?
Adam 
He's been talking to humans.
Mother 
What?
Father 
Talking to humans?!
Adam 
He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
Mother 
Make out? Barry!
Barry 
We do not.
Adam 
You wish you could.
Father 
Whose side are you on?
Barry 
The bees!
Uncle Carl
(He has been sitting in the back of the room this entire time) I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Mother
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
Barry 
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
Barry
Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
Mother 
I remember that.
Barry 
What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
Adam 
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
Barry 
Sting them where it really hurts.
Father 
In the face! The eye! That would hurt.
Barry 
No.
Father 
Up the nose? That's a killer.
Barry
There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. 
Flash forward a bit in time:
(and we are watching the Bee News) 
Bee News Narrator
Hive at Five, the hive's only full hour action news source.
Bee Protestor
No more bee beards!
Bee News Narrator
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
Bee News Narrator
Weather with Storm Stinger.
Bee News Narrator
Sports with Buzz Larvi.
Bee News Narrator
And Jeanette Chung.
Bob Bumble
Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
Jeanette Chung 
And I'm Jeanette Chung.
Bob Bumble
A tri county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
Jeanette Chung
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. 
The scene 
(changes to an interview on the news with Bee version of Larry King and Barry)
Bee Larry King 
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
Bee Larry King
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this"?
Barry
Bees have never been afraid to change the world.
Barry 
What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
Bee Larry King 
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
Barry 
How old are you?
Bee Larry King
The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
Barry
You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
Bee Larry King 
It's a common name. Next week...
Barry
He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
Bee Larry King 
Next week...
Barry
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
Bee Larry King 
Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here, live. 
Bee Larry King 
(gets annoyed and flies away offscreen)
Barry
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. 
Flash forward in time:
(We see Vanessa enter and Ken enters behind her. They are arguing)
Ken 
In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
Vanessa 
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
Ken
Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
Barry 
(To Ken) Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.
Ken 
(Pointing at Barry) Is that that same bee?
Vanessa 
Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race.
Barry 
Hello.
Ken 
Hello, bee.
Vanessa 
This is Ken.
Barry 
(Recalling the "Winter Boots" incident earlier) Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
Ken 
(To Vanessa) Why does he talk again?
Vanessa 
Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
Ken 
But it's our yogurt night!
Vanessa
(Holding door open for Ken) Bye bye.
Ken 
(Yelling) Why is yogurt night so difficult?! 
Ken 
(leaves and Vanessa walks over to Barry. His workplace is a mess)
Vanessa 
You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
Barry
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
Adam 
Frosting... How many sugars?
Barry
Just one. I try not to use the competition.
Barry 
So why are you helping me?
Vanessa 
Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
Barry 
Those are great, if you're three.
Vanessa 
And artificial flowers.
Barry 
Oh, those just get me psychotic!
Vanessa 
Yeah, me too.
Barry 
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
Adam 
Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
Vanessa 
This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
Barry 
I guess.
Adam 
You sure you want to go through with it?
Barry
Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, "Honey, I'm home," without paying a royalty! 
Flash forward in time:
(and we are watching the human news. The camera shows a crowd outside a courthouse)
News Reporter
It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. (We are no longer watching through a news camera)
Adam 
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
Barry 
It's pretty big, isn't it?
Adam
(Looking at the hundreds of people around the courthouse) I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
Barry
You think billion dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?
Security Guard
Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. 
A limousine 
(drives up and a fat man, Layton Montgomery, a honey industry owner gets out and walks past Barry)
Adam 
What's the matter?
Barry 
I don't know, I just got a chill.
Fast forward in time:
(and everyone is in the court)
Montgomery 
Well, if it isn't the bee team. (To Honey Industry lawyers) You boys work on this?
Man 
All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
Judge Bumbleton
All right. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
Judge Bumbleton
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
Montgomery 
A privilege.
Judge Bumbleton
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? 
Everyone 
(looks closely, they are waiting to see if a Bee can really talk) 
Barry 
(makes several buzzing sounds to sound like a Bee)
Barry
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. 
Judge Bumbleton
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
Montgomery
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
Montgomery
If we lived in the topsy turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
Montgomery
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
Montgomery
Talking bee! (Montgomery walks over and looks closely at Barry) How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion picture capture Hollywood wizardry?
Montgomery
They could be using laser beams!
Montgomery
Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
Judge Bumbleton 
Mr. Benson?
Barry
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.
Barry
It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.
Barry
Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! 
Mother
(To Father) I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
Judge Bumbleton 
Call your first witness.
Barry
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. 
Klauss Vanderhayden 
I suppose so.
Barry 
I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!
Klauss
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
Barry
Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee free-ers, do you?
Klauss 
(Quietly) No.
Barry 
I couldn't hear you.
Klauss 
No.
Barry 
No.
Barry
Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. 
Klauss 
They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build A Bear.
Barry 
You mean like this? 
The bear from Over The Hedge 
(barges in through the back door and it is roaring and standing on its hind legs. It is thrashing its claws and people are screaming. It is being held back by a guard who has the bear on a chain)
Barry
(Pointing to the roaring bear) Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!
Barry
Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!
Judge Bumbleton 
OK, that's enough. Take him away. (The bear stops roaring and thrashing and walks out)
Barry 
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?
Mr. Sting 
I was with a band called The Police.
Barry
But you've never been a police officer, have you?
Sting 
No, I haven't.
Barry
No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance about stage name.
Sting 
Oh, please.
Barry 
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
Montgomery 
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
Barry
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
Ray Liotta
Thank you. Thank you.
Barry
I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
Ray Liotta
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Barry
Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
Ray Liotta
Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
Barry 
This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! (Ray Liottalooses it and tries to grab Barry)
Ray Liotta
Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
Judge Bumbleton 
Order in this court!
Ray Liotta
You're all thinking it! 
Judge Bumbleton 
(starts banging her gavel)
Judge Bumbleton 
Order! Order, I say!
Ray Liotta
Say it!
Man 
Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
(We see a montage of magazines which feature the court case)
(Flash forward in time and Barry is back home with Vanessa)
Barry
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.
Vanessa 
I think the jury's on our side.
Barry 
Are we doing everything right,you know, legally?
Vanessa 
I'm a florist.
Barry 
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
Vanessa 
To a great team! 
Ken 
(walks in from work. He sees Barry and he looks upset when he sees Barry clinking his glass with Vanessa)
Ken 
Well, hello.
Vanessa 
Oh, Ken!
Barry 
Hello!
Vanessa 
I didn't think you were coming.
Ken
No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... (Ken holds up his phone and flips it open. The phone has no charge) ...the battery...
Vanessa
I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Ken
Oh, that was lucky. 
Ken 
(sits down at the table across from Barry and Vanessa leaves the room)
Vanessa 
There's a little left. I could heat it up.
Ken 
(Not taking his eyes off Barry) Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
Barry 
So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. 
Barry
The ball's a little grabby.
Ken 
That's where I usually sit. Right... (Points to where Barry is sitting) there.
Vanessa 
(Calling from other room) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
Ken 
(To Barry) You think I don't see what you're doing?
Barry 
I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.
Ken 
Do we?
Barry
Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
Ken 
(Menacingly) That's just what I was thinking about doing. (Ken reaches for a fork on the table but knocks it on the floor. He goes to pick it up)
Vanessa
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. (Ken quickly rises back up after hearing this but hits his head on the table and yells)
Barry 
I'm going to drain the old Stinger.
Ken
Yeah, you do that. 
Barry 
(flies past Ken to get to the bathroom and Ken freaks out, splashing some of the wine he was using to cool his head in his eyes. He yells in anger) 
Barry 
(looks at the magazines featuring his victories in court)
Barry 
Look at that.
Barry 
(flies into the bathroom) 
Ken
(puts his hand on his head but this makes hurts him and makes him even madder. He yells again) 
Barry 
(is washing his hands in the sink but then Ken walks in)
Ken 
You know, you know I've just about had it (Closes bathroom door behind him) with your little mind games.
Ken 
(is menacingly rolling up a magazine)
Barry 
(Backing away) What's that?
Ken 
Italian Vogue.
Barry 
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
Ken 
It's a lot of ads.
Barry
Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?
Ken 
That's funny, I just can't seem to recall that! (Ken smashes everything off the sink with the magazine and Barry narrowly escapes) (Ken follows Barry around and tries to hit him with the magazine but he keeps missing) 
Ken 
(gets a spray bottle) I think something stinks in here!
Barry 
(Enjoying the spray) I love the smell of flowers. 
Ken 
(holds a lighter in front of the spray bottle)
Ken 
How do you like the smell of flames?!
Barry
Not as much. 
Ken 
(fires his make shift flamethrower but misses Barry, burning the bathroom. He torches the whole room but looses his footing and falls into the bathtub. After getting hit in the head by falling objects 3 times he picks up the shower head, revealing a Water bug hiding under it)
Water Bug
Water bug! Not taking sides! 
Barry 
(gets up out of a pile of bathroom supplies and he is wearing a chapstick hat)
Barry 
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! 
Ken
This is pathetic! (Ken switches the shower head to lethal)
Ken
I've got issues! (Ken sprays Barry with the shower head and he crash lands into the toilet) (Ken menacingly looks down into the toilet at Barry) Well, well, well, a royal flush!
Barry 
You're bluffing.
Ken 
Am I? (flushes toilet) 
Barry 
(grabs a chapstick from the toilet seat and uses it to surf in the flushing toilet)
Barry
Surf's up, dude! (Barry flies out of the toilet on the chapstick and sprays Ken's face with the toilet water)
Ken
Ew, Poo water!
Barry 
That bowl is gnarly.
Ken 
(Aiming a toilet cleaner at Barry) Except for those dirty yellow rings! 
Barry 
(cowers and covers his head and Vanessa runs in and takes the toilet cleaner from Ken just before he hits Barry)
Vanessa 
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
Ken
(Leaning towards Barry) You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!
Vanessa 
We need to talk! (Vanessa pulls Ken out of the bathroom)
Vanessa
He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Ken 
Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?
Vanessa
No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!
Ken 
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!
Vanessa
Goodbye, Ken. 
Ken 
(huffs and walks out and slams the door. But suddenly he walks back in and stares at Barry)
Ken
And for your information, I prefer sugar free, artificial sweeteners MADE BY Man! (Ken leaves again and Vanessa leans in towards Barry)
Vanessa 
I'm sorry about all that.
Ken 
(walks back in again)
Ken
I know it's got an aftertaste! I LIKE IT! (Ken leaves for the last time)
Vanessa
I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.
Vanessa
Oh, well.  Are you OK for the trial?
Barry
I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. 
Flash forward in time 
(Barry, Adam, and Vanessa are back in court)
Montgomery
We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
Adam
Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... (Barry stares at Adam) ...Yeah.
Lawyer
Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.
Montgomery
Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. 
Montgomery
(To lawyer) You got the tweezers?
Lawyer
Are you allergic?
Montgomery 
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
Montgomery
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.
Montgomery
What exactly is your relationship (Points to Vanessa)
Montgomery
to that woman?
Barry 
We're friends.
Montgomery 
Good friends?
Barry 
Yes.
Montgomery 
How good? Do you live together?
Adam 
Wait a minute...
Montgomery 
Are you her little...
Montgomery
...bedbug?
Adam's Stinger 
(starts vibrating. He is agitated) 
Montgomery
I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?
Barry 
Yeah, but...
Montgomery 
(Pointing at Mother and Father) So those aren't your real parents!
Mother 
Oh, Barry...
Barry 
Yes, they are!
Adam 
Hold me back! 
Vanessa 
(tries to hold Adam back. He wants to Sting Montgomery)
Montgomery
You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?
Adam 
He's denouncing bees!
Montgomery 
Don't y'all date your cousins? 
Montgomery 
(leans over on the jury stand and stares at Adam)
Vanessa
Objection! (Vanessa raises her hand to object but Adam gets free. He flies straight at Montgomery)
Adam 
I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Barry 
Adam, don't! It's what he wants! 
Adam 
(stings Montgomery in the butt and he starts thrashing around)
Montgomery 
Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!
Judge Bumbleton 
(Banging gavel) Order! Order!
Montgomery 
(Overreacting) The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!
Montgomery
You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!
Barry 
Adam, stay with me.
Adam 
I can't feel my legs.
Montgomery
(Overreacting and throwing his body around the room) What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?
Judge Bumbleton
I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! 
Flash forward in time 
(we see a human News Reporter)
News Reporter
The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. 
Adam 
(is laying in a hospital bed and Barry flies in to see him)
Barry 
Hey, buddy.
Adam 
Hey.
Barry 
Is there much pain?
Adam 
Yeah.
Adam
I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?
Barry
It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.
Adam 
I'd be better off dead. Look at me. (A small plastic sword is replaced as Adam's Stinger)
Adam
They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. 
Adam
Look, there's a little celery still on it. (Flicks off the celery and sighs)
Barry 
What was it like to Sting someone?
Adam 
I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!
Barry 
...All right.
Adam 
You think it was all a trap?
Barry 
Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.
Barry
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.
Adam
What will the humans do to us if they win?
Barry 
I don't know.
Adam 
I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.
Barry 
Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!
Adam 
Oh, my.
Adam
(Coughs) Could you get a nurse to close that window?
Barry 
Why?
Adam 
The smoke.(We can see that two humans are smoking cigarettes outside)
Adam
Bees don't smoke.
Barry 
Right. Bees don't smoke.
Barry
Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case!
Adam 
It is? It's not over?
Barry 
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. 
Flash forward in time 
(Adam is making a paper boat in the courtroom)
Adam 
And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub! (We see that the jury have each made their own paper boats after being taught how by Adam. They all look confused)
Judge Bumbleton 
Mr. Flayman.
Adam 
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
Judge Bumbleton 
Where is the rest of your team?
Adam 
(Continues stalling) Well, Your Honor, it's intereSting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.
Adam 
I actually heard a funny story about...
Montgomery
Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?
Montgomery
They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!
Judge Bumbleton
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.
Adam 
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Montgomery 
Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?
Montgomery
Show me the smoking gun!
Barry
(flies in through the door) Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?
Barry
Here is your smoking gun. 
Vanessa 
(walks in holding a bee smoker. She sets it down on the Judge's podium)
Judge Bumbleton 
What is that?
Barry 
It's a bee smoker!
Montgomery 
(Picks up smoker) What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. 
Montgomery 
(accidentally fires it at the bees in the crowd and they faint and cough) 
Dozens of reporters 
(start taking pictures of the suffering bees)
Barry
Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non?"
Barry
Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man made wooden slat work camps?
Barry
Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? (Barry points to the honey industry owners. One of them is an African American so he awkwardly separates himself from the others)
Lawyer 
What are we gonna do? He's playing the species card.
Barry
Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! 
Adam and Vanessa 
Free the bees! Free the bees!
Bees in Crowd 
Free the bees!
Human Jury 
Free the bees! Free the bees!
Judge Bumbleton 
The court finds in favor of the bees!
Barry 
Vanessa, we won!
Vanessa 
I knew you could do it! High five! 
Vanessa 
(hits Barry hard because her hand is too big) Sorry.
Barry 
(Overjoyed) I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.
Montgomery
This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. 
Montgomery 
(leaves and Barry goes outside the courtroom. Several reporters start asking Barry questions)
Reporter #1
Barry, how much honey is out there?
Barry 
All right. One at a time.
Reporter #2
Barry, who are you wearing?
Barry 
My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. 
Barry 
(flies outside with the paparazzi and Adam and Vanessa stay back)
Adam 
(To Vanessa) What if Montgomery's right?
Vanessa 
What do you mean?
Adam
We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. 
Flash forward in time 
(and Barry is talking to a man)
Business Man 
Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?
Barry
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. (As Barry is talking we see a montage of men putting "closed" tape over the work camps and freeing the bees in the crappy apartments) 
Barry
Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. (Men in suits are pushing all the honey of the aisle and into carts) 
Barry
We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more (We see a statue of a bear shaped honey container being pulled down by bees) than a filthy, smelly, bad breath stink machine.
Barry
We're all aware of what they do in the woods. (We see Winnie the Pooh sharing his honey with Piglet in the cross hairs of a high tech sniper rifle)
Barry 
(Looking through binoculars) Wait for my signal.
Barry
Take him out. (Winnie gets hit by a tranquilizer dart and dramatically falls off the log he was standing on, his tongue hanging out. Piglet looks at Pooh in fear and the Sniper takes the honey.)
Sniper
He'll have nausea for a few hours, then he'll be fine. (Flash forward in time)
Barry
And we will no longer tolerate bee negative nicknames... (Mr. Sting is sitting at home until he is taken out of his house by the men in suits)
Sting 
But it's just a prance about stage name!
Barry
...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la dee da human tea time snack garnishments. (An old lady is mixing honey into her tea but suddenly men in suits smash her face down on the table and take the honey)
Old Lady
Can't breathe. (A honey truck pulls up to Barry's hive)
Worker 
Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good.
Worker
Tap it. (Tons of honey is being pumped into the hive's storage)
Bee Worker #1
(Honey overflows from the cup) Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!
Bee Worker #1
I think we need to shut down!
Bee Worker #2 
Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production!
Dean Buzzwell
Stop making honey! 
The bees 
(all leave their stations. Two bees run into a room and they put the keys into a machine)
Dean Buzzwell
Turn your key, sir! (Two worker bees dramatically turn their keys, which opens the button which they press, shutting down the honey making machines. This is the first time this has ever happened)
Bee
...What do we do now? 
Flash forward in time 
(a Bee is about to jump into a pool full of honey) Cannonball! (The bee gets stuck in the honey and we get a short montage of Bees leaving work) (We see the Pollen Jocks flying but one of them gets a call on his antenna)
Lou Lu Duva 
(Through "phone") We're shutting honey production! Mission abort.
Pollen Jock #1
Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.
The Pollen Jocks 
(fly back to the hive) (We get a time lapse of Central Park slowly wilting away as the bees all relax)
Barry
Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.
Adam 
Oh, yeah?
Barry 
What's going on? Where is everybody? (The entire street is deserted) Are they out celebrating?
Adam 
They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.
Adam
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.
Barry 
At least we got our honey back.
Adam
Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
Adam
It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.
Adam
And now... Now I can't. 
Flash forward in time 
(Barry is talking to Vanessa)
Barry
I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better!
Barry
They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.
Vanessa
You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?
Barry 
What did you want to show me? 
Vanessa 
(takes Barry to the rooftop where they first had coffee and points to her store)
Vanessa 
This. (Points at her flowers. They are all grey and wilting)
Barry 
What happened here?
Vanessa 
That is not the half of it. 
Small flash forward in time 
(Vanessa and Barry are on the roof of her store and she points to Central Park) (We see that Central Park is no longer green and colorful, rather it is grey, brown, and dead like. It is very depressing to look at)
Barry 
Oh, no. Oh, my.
Barry
They're all wilting.
Vanessa 
Doesn't look very good, does it?
Barry 
No.
Vanessa 
And whose fault do you think that is?
Barry 
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
Vanessa
(Staring at Barry) Bees?
Barry 
Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.
Vanessa 
It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
Barry 
That's our whole SAT test right there.
Vanessa
Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.
Vanessa
And then, of course...
Barry 
The human species?
Barry
So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?
Vanessa 
I know this is also partly my fault.
Barry 
How about a suicide pact?
Vanessa 
How do we do it?
Barry 
I'll Sting you, you step on me.
Vanessa 
That just kills you twice.
Barry 
Right, right.
Vanessa
Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. (Vanessa leaves)
Barry 
(To himself) I had to open my mouth and talk.
Barry 
Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? (Vanessa is getting into a taxi)
Vanessa
To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.
Vanessa
It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.
Barry 
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.
Vanessa 
I know. Me neither. (The taxi starts to drive away)
Barry 
Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.
Barry
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses!
Barry
Vanessa! (Barry flies after the Taxi)
Vanessa 
Roses?! Barry? 
Barry 
(is flying outside the window of the taxi)
Barry 
Roses are flowers!
Vanessa 
Yes, they are.
Barry 
Flowers, bees, pollen!
Vanessa 
I know. That's why this is the last parade.
Barry 
Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down?
Vanessa 
Could you slow down? (The taxi driver screeches to a stop and Barry keeps flying forward)
Vanessa
Barry! (Barry flies back to the window)
Barry 
OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.
Vanessa 
Yes, it kind of is.
Barry 
I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.
Vanessa 
Actually, it's completely closed down.
Barry 
I thought maybe you were remodeling. 
Barry
But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.
Vanessa 
I don't want to hear it!
Barry
All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.
Barry
All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.
Barry
Bees.
Vanessa 
Park.
Barry 
Pollen!
Vanessa 
Flowers.
Barry 
Re-pollination!
Vanessa 
Across the nation!
Vanessa
Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight.
Barry
I have an idea. (Flash forward in time. Vanessa is about to board a plane which has all the Roses on board.
Vanessa 
Vanessa Bloome, FTD. (Holds out badge)
Vanessa
Official floral business. It's real.
Security Guard 
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
Vanessa
Thank you. It was a gift.
Barry 
(is revealed to be hiding inside the brooch) 
Flash back in time
(Barry and Vanessa are discussing their plan)
Barry
Once inside, we just pick the right float.
Vanessa 
How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!
Barry 
Yes, I got it.
Barry
Where should I sit?
Guard 
What are you?
Barry 
I believe I'm the pea.
Guard 
The pea?
Vanessa 
It goes under the mattresses.
Guard 
Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. I'm getting the marshal.
Vanessa 
You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!
Vanessa
Let's see what this baby'll do. (Vanessa drives the float through traffic)
Guard
Hey, what are you doing?!
Barry
Then all we do is blend in with traffic...
Barry 
...without arousing suspicion.
Barry
Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. 
Flash forward in time 
(Barry and Vanessa are about to get on a plane)
Security Guard 
Stop! Security. You and your insect pack your float?
Vanessa 
Yes.
Security Guard
Has it been in your possession the entire time? 
Vanessa 
Yes.
Security Guard 
Would you remove your shoes?
Security Guard
(To Barry) Remove your Stinger.
Barry 
It's part of me.
Security Guard 
I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. 
Barry
(Barry plotting with Vanessa) Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. 
Flash forward in time 
(Barry and Vanessa are flying on the plane) Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!
Vanessa 
I think this is gonna work.
Barry 
It's got to work.
Captain Scott 
(On intercom) Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York.
Captain Scott 
It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.
Vanessa
Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.
Barry
I gotta get up there and talk to them. 
Vanessa
Be careful. (Barry flies right outside the cockpit door)
Barry
Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. 
The flight attendant 
(opens the door and walks out and Barry flies into the cockpit unseen)
Barry 
Captain, I'm in a real situation.
Captain Scott 
What'd you say, Hal?
Co-Pilot Hal
Nothing.
Scott 
(notices Barry and freaks out)
Captain Scott 
Bee!
Barry 
No,no,no, Don't freak out! My entire species... 
Captain Scott 
(gets out of his seat and tries to suck Barry into a handheld vacuum)
Hal 
(To Scott) What are you doing? 
Barry 
(lands on Hals hair but Scott sees him. He tries to suck up Barry but instead he sucks up Hals toupee)
Captain Scott 
Uh oh.
Barry 
Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
Hal
(doesn't know Barry is on his head) Who's an attorney?
Captain Scott
Don't move. 
Scott 
(hits Hal in the face with the vacuum in an attempt to hit Barry. Hal is knocked out and he falls on the life raft button which launches an infalatable boat into Scott, who gets knocked out and falls to the floor. They are both unconscious.)
Barry 
(To himself) Oh, Barry.
Barry 
(On intercom, with a Southern accent) Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.
Barry
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? (Vanessa looks confused)
Barry
(Normal accent) ...And please hurry! 
Vanessa 
(opens the door and sees the life raft and the uncounscious pilots)
Vanessa 
What happened here?
Barry
I tried to talk to them, but then there was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.
Barry
Now one's bald, one's in a boat, and they're both unconscious!
Vanessa 
...Is that another bee joke?
Barry 
No! No one's flying the plane!
Bud Ditchwater 
(Through radio on plane) This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?
Vanessa 
This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.
Bud
Where's the pilot?
Vanessa
He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.
Bud
Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?
Barry 
As a matter of fact, there is.
Bud 
Who's that?
Barry 
Barry Benson.
Bud 
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Barry
Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines.
Vanessa 
I can't fly a plane.
Barry 
Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
Vanessa 
Yes.
Barry 
How hard could it be? 
Vanessa 
(sits down and flies for a little bit but we see lightning clouds outside the window)
Vanessa 
Wait, Barry!
Vanessa
We're headed into some lightning. (An ominous lightning storm looms in front of the plane) (We are now watching the Bee News)
Bob Bumble
This is Bob Bumble. We have some late breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...
Adam 
That's Barry!
Bob Bumble
...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. 
Mother, Father, Uncle Car and Adam 
Flowers?! (The scene switches to the human news)
Reporter 
(Talking with Bob Bumble) We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.
Bob Bumble 
Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.
Bud
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no account compadres.
Bud 
They've done enough damage.
Reporter
But isn't he your only hope?
Bud
Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small...
Barry 
(Through radio) Haven't we heard this a million times? "The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."...
Bob Bumble 
Get this on the air!
Bee
Got it.
Bee News Crew 
Stand by.
Bee News Crew
We're going live!
Barry 
(Through radio on TV) ...The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.
Barry
But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.
Barry
More than we realized.
Barry
To us, to everyone.
Barry
That's why I want to get bees back to working together.
Barry
That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.
Barry
We get behind a fellow.
Barry
Black and yellow!
Bees
Hello!
The scene 
(switches and Barry is teaching Vanessa how to fly) 
Barry 
Left, right, down, hover.
Vanessa 
Hover?
Barry 
Forget hover.
Vanessa 
This isn't so hard.
Vanessa
(Pretending to honk the horn) Beep beep! Beep beep! 
A Lightning bolt 
(hits the plane and autopilot turns off) Barry, what happened?!
Barry
Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.
Vanessa 
That may have been helping me.
Barry 
And now we're not!
Vanessa 
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. 
The plane 
(plummets but we see Lou Lu Duva and the Pollen Jocks, along with multiple other bees flying towards the plane)
Lou Lu Duva
All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!
Lou Lu Duva
Move out! 
The scene 
(switches back to Vanessa and Barry in the plane)
Barry
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!
Barry 
(sticks out his arms like an airplane and flys in front of Vanessa's face)
Vanessa 
Don't have to yell.
Barry 
I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.
Vanessa
It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!
Barry 
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
Vanessa 
I can't do this! (Barry slaps Vanessa)
Barry 
Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!
Vanessa 
(Slaps Barry) You snap out of it.
Barry 
(Slaps Vanessa) You snap out of it.
Vanessa 
You snap out of it!
Barry 
You snap out of it! 
We see 
(that all the Pollen Jocks are flying under the plane)
Vanessa 
You snap out of it!
Barry 
You snap out of it!
Vanessa 
You snap out of it!
Barry 
You snap out of it!
Vanessa 
Hold it!
Barry 
Why? Come on, it's my turn.
Vanessa 
How is the plane flying? 
The plane 
(is now safely flying)
Vanessa 
I don't know. 
Barry's antennae 
(rings like a phone. Barry picks up)
Barry 
Hello?
Lou Lu Duva
(Through "phone") Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? 
All of the Pollen Jocks 
(are carrying the plane)
Barry 
The Pollen Jocks!
Barry 
They do get behind a fellow.
Lou Lu Duva
Black and yellow.
Pollen Jocks 
Hello.
Lou Lu Duva
All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.
Barry 
Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
Vanessa 
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
Vanessa
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
Barry 
Thinking bee. Thinking bee.(On the runway there are millions of bees laying on their backs)
Bees
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Barry 
Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.
Vanessa 
What?
Barry 
I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
Barry
Like a 27 million year old instinct. Bring the nose down.
Bees
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Control Tower Operator 
What in the world is on the tarmac?
Bud
Get some lights on that! (It is revealed that all the bees are organized into a giant pulsating flower formation)
Bees
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Barry 
Vanessa, aim for the flower.
Vanessa 
OK.
Barry
Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?
Lou Lu Duva
Affirmative!
Barry 
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
Barry
Land on that flower!
Barry
Ready? Full reverse!
Barry
Spin it around! (The plane's nose is pointed at a flower painted on a nearby plane) Not that flower! The other one!
Vanessa 
Which one?
Barry
That flower. 
The plane 
(is now pointed at a fat guy in a flowered shirt. He freaks out and tries to take a picture of the plane)
Vanessa 
I'm aiming at the flower!
Barry 
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! (The plane hovers over the bee flower)
Barry
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
Barry
Rotate around it.
Vanessa 
This is insane, Barry!
Barry 
This's the only way I know how to fly.
Bud
Am I koo koo kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect like pattern? 
The plane 
(is unrealistically hovering and spinning over the bee flower)
Barry 
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!
Barry
Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center!
Barry
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
Barry
Come on, already. 
The bees 
(scatter and the plane safely lands) 
Vanessa 
Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!
Barry 
Yes! (Vanessa is about to high five Barry) No high five!
Vanessa 
Right.
Adam 
Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?
Barry 
What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!
Adam 
Thank you.
Barry 
But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! 
Barry
This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.
Barry 
That means this is our last chance.
Barry
We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?
Barry
Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?
Bees
We're bees!
Bee who likes Keychains 
Keychain!
Barry 
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
Pollen Jock #1 
Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this.
Barry 
Yeah!
Barry
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. 
The Pollen Jocks 
(throw Barry a nectar collecting gun. Barry catches it) Oh, yeah.
Mother 
That's our Barry.
Barry and the Pollen Jocks
(get pollen from the flowers on the plane) 
Flash forward in time 
(the Pollen Jocks are flying over NYC)
Barry 
(pollinates the flowers in Vanessa's shop and then heads to Central Park)
Boy in Park
Mom! The bees are back!
Adam 
(Putting on his Krelman hat) If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.
Adam
I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! (The bee honey factories are back up and running) Meanwhile 
(at Vanessa's shop)
Vanessa 
(To customer) Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?
Vanessa
Would you like some honey with that? It is bee approved. Don't forget these.
There is a room in the shop 
(where Barry does legal work for other animals. He is currently talking with a Cow)
Cow
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!
Barry 
I had no idea.
Vanessa 
Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?
Barry 
Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.
Mooseblood 
Sorry I'm late.
Cow
He's a lawyer too?
Mooseblood 
Ma'am, I was already a blood sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.
Vanessa 
Have a great afternoon!
Vanessa
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.
Barry 
No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.
Vanessa 
You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?
Barry 
All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.
Vanessa 
Thank you, Barry! 
Ken 
(walks by on the sidewalk and sees the "bee approved honey" in Vanessa's shop)
Ken 
That bee is living my life!!
Andy 
Let it go, Kenny.
Ken 
When will this nightmare end?!
Andy
Let it all go.
Barry 
Beautiful day to fly.
Pollen Jock
Sure is.
Barry 
Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. 
Barry 
(recreates the scene near the beginning of the movie where he flies through the box kite. The movie fades to black and the credits)
After Credits 
[No scene can be seen but the characters can be heard talking over the credits] [n]You have got to start thinking bee, my friend! [n][n] Thinking bee! [n][n] Me?
Barry 
(Talking over singer) Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.
Barry 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?
Singer
Oh, Barry. 
Barry
I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!
Singer 
All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.
Barry 
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
