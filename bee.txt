According to all known laws of aviation, [newline here]there is no way a bee should be able to fly. [newline here][newline here]Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. [newline here]The bee, of course, flies anyway [newline here]because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Barry
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
Mother
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Barry
Coming! Hang on a second. 
Barry
(uses his antenna like a phone) Hello?
Adam
Barry?
Barry
Adam?
Adam
Can you believe this is happening?
Barry
I can't. I'll pick you up.
Barry
(flies down the stairs)
Father
Looking sharp.
Mother
Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
Barry
Sorry. I'm excited.
Father
Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's.
Mother
Very proud. (Rubs Barry's hair)
Barry
Ma! I got a thing going here.
Mother
You got lint on your fuzz.
Barry
Ow! That's me!
Mother
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye!
Mother
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Barry
Hey, Adam.
Adam
Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel?
Barry
A little. Special day, graduation.
Adam
Never thought I'd make it.
Barry
Three days grade school, three days high school...
Adam
Those were awkward.
Barry
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
Adam
You did come back different.
Artie
Hi, Barry!
Barry
Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Adam
Hear about Frankie?
Barry
Yeah.
Adam
You going to the funeral?
Barry
No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
Adam
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
The car
(does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)
Adam
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day.
Barry
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
Graduating Students
[playing "Pomp and Circumstances"]
Barry
Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
Barry
Well, Adam, today we are men.
Adam
We are!
Barry
Bee-men.
Adam
Amen!
Barry and Adam
Hallelujah!
Announcer
Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Dean Buzzwell
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... 9:15.
Dean Buzzwell
That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Adam
Will we pick our job today?
Barry
I heard it's just orientation.
Tour Guide
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry
This is it!
Barry and Adam
Wow.
Barry
Wow.
Tour Guide
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Tour Guide
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble scented and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
Everyone
Honey!
Tour Guide
[collects honey into a bottle and throws it into the crowd on the bus, where it is caught by a girl in the back.]
Adam
That girl was hot.
Barry
She's my cousin!
Adam
She is?
Barry
Yes, we're all cousins.
Adam
Right. You're right.
Tour Guide
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
Helmet Tester
[is being smashed into the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers, and boots. He lifts a thumbs up, but you can hear him groan]
Adam
What do you think he makes?
Barry
Not enough.
Tour Guide
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
Krelman Testers
[a wheel turns with bees on pegs, each of them wearing a finger-shaped hat.]
Barry
Wow, what does that do?
Tour Guide
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
Adam
[intrigued] Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Tour Guide
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
Everyone but Barry
[claps]
Barry
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
Adam
What's the difference?
Tour Guide
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
Barry
[upset] So you'll just work us to death?
Tour Guide
We'll sure try.
Everyone but Barry
[laughs]
[end scene]
[Barry and Adam are walking home together]
Adam
Wow! That blew my mind!
Barry
"Whats the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
Adam
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
Barry
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Adam
Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
Barry
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Adam
Like what? Give me one example.
[Barry and Adam stop walking]
[Hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect unison]
Barry
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Announcer
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Barry
Wait a second. Check it out.
Pollen Jocks
[fly in, circle around, land, and stand in line]
Barry
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Adam
Wow. I've never seen them this close.
Barry
They know what it's like outside the hive.
Adam
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Girl Bees
Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks!
Pollen Jock
[hook up their backpacks to pumps that transport nectar]
Lou Lo Duva
You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! [punching the pollen jocks in joy] I love it!
Adam
I wonder where they were.
Barry
I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Adam
Right.
Barry and Adam
(are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks)
Barry
Look at that. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
Adam
It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.
Barry
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. (waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)
Adam
Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
Barry
Distant. Distant.
Pollen Jock #1
Look at these two.
Pollen Jock #2
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Pollen Jock #1
Let's have fun with them.
Girl Bee #1
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Barry
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
Girl Bee #2
Oh, my!
Barry
I never thought I'd knock him out.
Girl Bee #1
(Looking at Adam) What were you doing during this?
Adam
Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
Barry
I can autograph that.
Pollen Jocks 
(walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and Adam really are pollen jocks.)
Pollen Jock #1
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Barry
Yeah. Gusty.
Pollen Jock #1
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Barry
Six miles, huh?
Adam
Barry!
Pollen Jock #2
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Barry
Maybe I am.
Adam
You are not!
Pollen Jock #1
We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?
Barry
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
The Scene
(cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at night)
Father
Hey, Honex!
Barry
Dad, you surprised me.
Father
You decide what you're interested in?
Barry
Well, there's a lot of choices. But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Father
Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.
Barry
You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
Father
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Father
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Mother
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
Barry
I'm not trying to be funny.
Father
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
Mother
You're gonna be a stirrer?
Barry
No one's listening to me!
Father
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
Barry
I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Barry's parents
(don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)
Father
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Barry
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
Janet
I'm so proud.
The Scene
(cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)
Adam
We're starting work today!
Barry
Today's the day.
Adam
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Barry
Yeah, right.
Job Lister
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Bee in front of line
Is it still available?
Job Lister
Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side.
Adam
What'd you get?
Bee in front of line
Picking crud out. Stellar! (He walks away)
Adam
Wow!
Job Lister
Couple of newbies?
Adam
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Job Lister
Make your choice.
Adam and Barry
(look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very confusing)
Adam
You want to go first?
Barry
No, you go.
Adam
Oh, my. What's available?
Job Lister
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Adam
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Job Lister
Sure, you're on. (Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head) (Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)
Job Lister
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. (Takes Adam's hat off) Wax monkey's always open.
Adam
The Krelman opened up again. What happened?
Job Lister
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Job Lister
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Adam
Oh, this is so hard! Stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry
(remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off) 
Adam
(turns around and sees Barry flying away) Barry!
Pollen Jock
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
Adam
(Through phone) What happened to you? Where are you?
Barry
I'm going out.
Adam
Out? Out where?
Barry
Out there.
Adam
Oh, no!
Barry
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
Adam
You're gonna die! You're crazy! [newline here](Barry hangs up) [newline here]Hello?
Pollen Jock #2
Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Barry
Hey, guys.
Pollen Jock #1
Look at that.
Pollen Jock #2
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Lou Lo Duva
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
Pollen Jock #1
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. (Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)
Lou Lo Duva
(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Bee with clipboard
(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that. Thank you.
Lou Lo Duva
OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Lou Lo Duva
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
Barry
That's awful.
Lou Lo Duva
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
Lou Lo Duva
All right, launch positions!
