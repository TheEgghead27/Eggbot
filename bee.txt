Narrator
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Barry
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
Mother
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Barry
Coming! Hang on a second. 
Barry
(uses his antenna like a phone) Hello?
Adam
Barry?
Barry
Adam?
Adam
Can you believe this is happening?
Barry
I can't. I'll pick you up.
Barry
(flies down the stairs)
Father
Looking sharp.
Mother
Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
Barry
Sorry. I'm excited.
Father
Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's.
Mother
Very proud. (Rubs Barry's hair)
Barry
Ma! I got a thing going here.
Mother
You got lint on your fuzz.
Barry
Ow! That's me!
Mother
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye!
Mother
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Barry
Hey, Adam.
Adam
Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel?
Barry
A little. Special day, graduation.
Adam
Never thought I'd make it.
Barry
Three days grade school, three days high school...
Adam
Those were awkward.
Barry
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
Adam
You did come back different.
Artie
Hi, Barry!
Barry
Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Adam
Hear about Frankie?
Barry
Yeah.
Adam
You going to the funeral?
Barry
No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
Adam
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
The car
(does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)
Adam
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day.
Barry
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
Graduating Students
[playing "Pomp and Circumstances"]
Barry
Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
Barry
Well, Adam, today we are men.
Adam
We are!
Barry
Bee-men.
Adam
Amen!
Barry and Adam
Hallelujah!
Announcer
Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Dean Buzzwell
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... 9:15.
Dean Buzzwell
That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Adam
Will we pick our job today?
Barry
I heard it's just orientation.
Tour Guide
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry
This is it!
Barry and Adam
Wow.
Barry
Wow.
Tour Guide
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Tour Guide
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble scented and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
Everyone
Honey!
Tour Guide
[collects honey into a bottle and throws it into the crowd on the bus, where it is caught by a girl in the back.]
Adam
That girl was hot.
Barry
She's my cousin!
Adam
She is?
Barry
Yes, we're all cousins.
Adam
Right. You're right.
Tour Guide
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
Helmet Tester
[is being smashed into the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers, and boots. He lifts a thumbs up, but you can hear him groan]
Adam
What do you think he makes?
Barry
Not enough.
Tour Guide
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
Krelman Testers
[a wheel turns with bees on pegs, each of them wearing a finger-shaped hat.]
Barry
Wow, what does that do?
Tour Guide
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
Adam
[intrigued] Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Tour Guide
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
Everyone but Barry
[claps]
Barry
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
Adam
What's the difference?
Tour Guide
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
Barry
[upset] So you'll just work us to death?
Tour Guide
We'll sure try.
Everyone but Barry
[laughs]
[end scene]
[Barry and Adam are walking home together]
Adam
Wow! That blew my mind!
Barry
"Whats the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
Adam
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
Barry
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Adam
Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
Barry
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Adam
Like what? Give me one example.
[Barry and Adam stop walking]
[Hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect unison]
Barry
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Announcer
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Barry
Wait a second. Check it out.
Pollen Jocks
[fly in, circle around, land, and stand in line]
Barry
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Adam
Wow. I've never seen them this close.
Barry
They know what it's like outside the hive.
Adam
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Girl Bees
Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks!
Pollen Jock
[hook up their backpacks to pumps that transport nectar]
Lou Lo Duva
You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! [punching the pollen jocks in joy] I love it!
Adam
I wonder where they were.
Barry
I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Adam
Right.
Barry and Adam
(are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks)
Barry
Look at that. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
Adam
It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.
Barry
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. (waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)
Adam
Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
Barry
Distant. Distant.
Pollen Jock #1
Look at these two.
Pollen Jock #2
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Pollen Jock #1
Let's have fun with them.
Girl Bee #1
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Barry
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
Girl Bee #2
Oh, my!
Barry
I never thought I'd knock him out.
Girl Bee #1
(Looking at Adam) What were you doing during this?
Adam
Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
Barry
I can autograph that.
Pollen Jocks 
(walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and Adam really are pollen jocks.)
Pollen Jock #1
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Barry
Yeah. Gusty.
Pollen Jock #1
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
